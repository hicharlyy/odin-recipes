        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A hearty soup, topped with crispy bacon. Perfect for a winter's night or any night, really. Let's pretend the things on the soup in this photo are pieces of bacon because I want to respect copyright, but also I don't feel like searching for another image.</p>
